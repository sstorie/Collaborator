# Collaborator

Collaborator is an experiment of mine to build a relatively simple application that allows multiple
users to edit data in a database table in real-time. The simple idea is that users can easily make
changes to data, and when those changes are succesfully persisted, they appear in the views for any
other users.

## Goals

I have a few main goals in mind:

- Make building a testable application _the_ priority
- Leverage SignalR to provide real-time communication
- Learn the Caliburn.Micro framework
- Better understand how to structure a VS solution to enable testing
